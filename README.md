# ✈️ Airways Reservation System

The **Airways Reservation System** is a mini web-based application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that simulates the basic functionality of an airline ticket booking system. It provides users with an interactive interface to input their travel details and get a confirmation upon submission.

## 📌 Project Overview

Air travel booking is a common need in the digital age, and this project demonstrates a simplified version of such a system. This reservation form acts as a frontend prototype where users can enter their flight information and receive a visual confirmation message. While no backend is used in this version, it lays a solid foundation for future integration with a database or server-side technology.
